starting from just a blank workspace, enter these commands to get node.js installed

$ wget http://nodejs.org/dist/node-v0.4.4.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf node-v0.4.4.tar.gz
$ cd node-v0.4.4
$ ./configure
$ sudo make install

Test it out by entering
$ node
> console.log('Hello World');

if successful, the output will be
'Hello World
undefined'


(WHY 'undefined'?   Every JavaScript function returns something. When you define function like this:

function test() {
    var x = 1;
}
then test() returns undefined. The same applies to the console.log function. What it does is that it 
passes the arguments to the display. And that's all. Thus it returns undefined. 
Now Node JS shell works in such a way that whenever you input a function, variable, etc. 
it displays the value it returned. Thus console.log('Hello world!'); passes Hello world! 
to the screen and returns undefined, which then Node JS shell displays.  THAT'S WHY)



To further test this, enter the following:

var http = require('http');

var server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end('Hello Http');
});
server.listen(8080);

Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser or if you are doing this in c9.io then 
view it in the Preview

INTERESTING "Now when you point your browser to 'localhost:8080', the connection 
closure is invoked with a req and res object. The req is a readable stream that 
emits 'data' events for each incoming piece of data (like a form submission or 
file upload). The res object is a writable stream that is used to send data back 
to the client."



CREATE YOUR package.json FILE

This is where other resources know, for example, where to start in your application

enter 'npm init' and just enter through everything


THEN npm install express --save


THEN in main.js

var express = require('express');

var app = express();
